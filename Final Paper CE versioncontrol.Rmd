# **Statistical Analysis of Behavioral Data**

Learning how to use RStudio, RMarkdown and GitHub
Dead line 02/06/2023
Intensive course online from 17 to 21 May
The present RMarkdown is the second time I do each Session as way to record the lessons and practice the use of R.


## **Session Summary 1 Intensive Course (170523)**

- Exercise 1 very difficult, watch the videos many times before hands on, and lost time
- Exercise 2 it feels little bit easier, but had problems to find some symbols in my pc
- Exercise 3 I got to solve the symbols problem and I used the link with the answers to get more familiar with the R language
- Exercise 4 R Markdown still a challenge at moment but I like it!

## **Session Summary 1 Second Course:**
- All the exercises were done following the Exercise Solutions codes and explanation. No issues during the process. 

#*Exercise 1*
#creating new directory and new script to check how much I learned during the course

#how to use help
help(mean)
?mean
help("mean")

#use the code plot
plot(1:10) 

#create variable first_num and assign the value 42
first_num <- 42
first_char <- "my first character"

#Remove the variable first_num from your environment using the rm() function.
rm(first_num)
#list all variables in the workspace 
ls()  

#assign another value to an existing variable
#Assign the value "my second character" to the variable first_char
first_char <- "my second variable"
#display the value
first_char

#useful directories in my Project directory
dir.create(path = 'data')
dir.create(path = 'output')
list.files(include.dirs = TRUE)

#doing the exercise for the second time, feels much easier to work in RStudio

##*Exercise 2*
#importing and manipulating data frames
#download the data file whaledata.xlsx
#Name the file ‘whaledata.txt’ and save it to the data directory
#import the ‘whaledata.txt’ file into R
whale <- read.table('data/whaledata.txt', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#use the head() function to display the first 5 rows of your dataframe
head(whale)

# use the names() function which will return a vector of variable names from your dataset
names(whale)

#use the str() function to display the structure of the dataset and a neat summary of your variables
str(whale)
# 'data.frame': 100 obs. of  8 variables:
#  $ month          : Factor w/ 2 levels "May","October": 1 1 1 1 ...
#  $ time.at.station: int  1344 1633 743 1050 1764 580 459 ...
#  $ water.noise    : Factor w/ 3 levels "high","low","medium": 2 3 3 3 ...
#  $ number.whales  : int  7 13 12 10 12 10 5 8 11 12 ...
#  $ latitude       : num  60.4 60.4 60.5 60.3 60.4 ...
#  $ longitude      : num  -4.18 -4.19 -4.62 -4.35 -5.2 ...
#  $ depth          : int  520 559 1006 540 1000 1000 993 988 ...
#  $ gradient       : int  415 405 88 409 97 173 162 162 245 161 ..

# the dataframe whale has 100 observations
# the dataframe whale has 8 variables
# the variables month and water.noise are factors

#get useful summary of your dataframe by using the summary() function
summary(whale)
#    month    time.at.station  water.noise number.whales      latitude        
# May    :50   Min.   :  60.0   high  :15   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :60.29   
# October:50   1st Qu.: 693.8   low   :28   1st Qu.: 9.00   1st Qu.:60.69   
#              Median :1077.5   medium:57   Median :11.00   Median :61.29  
#              Mean   :1064.7               Mean   :11.56   Mean   :61.16  
#              3rd Qu.:1349.2               3rd Qu.:14.00   3rd Qu.:61.59     
#              Max.   :2158.0               Max.   :28.00   Max.   :62.10     
#                                           NA's   :1    

# the variable number.whales has one missing value (NA)
